PWA-FRAMEWORK
=============
Based on <a href="https://bit.ly/cortex-cm" target="_blank">cortex-cm</a> &amp; <a href="bit.ly/travailleur-de-la-conscience" target="_blank">travailleur de la conscience</a>: Requirements, technical analysis (raw &amp; eventually more), and inception for a pwa-framework



PROCESS - TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
============================

## The process
The process is (re)defined as this:
1.  The technical analysis to define the API & processes
2.  An Inception phase to implement the requirements using chosen frameworks (vue.js, pyjamas|pyjs, react), not looking at the technical requirements/analysis (in order to do things the framework's way) for vue and react, and only eventually for pyjs...
3.  And the actual implementation phase, with the chosen framework (Test, Validate - Release, Publish)

**List of & process details for chosen frameworks**:
-   w/ vue.js
-   w/ pyjamas|pyjs
-   [transcrypt]\: once completed with pyjs, write one complete case with transcrypt
-   w/ react

With this process the different frameworks will/should use the same backend to implement the requirements...

### Dev Stack
The pertinence of the [dev stack] will be analyzed within and at the end of the process.
And at the end of or within the process, integration of/into the [slow framework][dev stack] should be analyzed and done.




# Technical analysis
 ... (raw &amp; messy, for now), is here: [technical requirements]
